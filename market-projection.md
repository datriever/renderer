### Energy Costs and Emissions: 2025 Projections

---

#### **Projected Electricity Costs (LCOE) for 2025**

The table below shows the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) for various energy sources in 2025. LCOE reflects the average cost per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced, making it a useful metric for comparing the affordability of different technologies.

| **Instrument**     | **LCOE Cost ($/MWh)** |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Biomass            | 146.3                 |
| Geothermal         | 91.6                  |
| Hydro              | 99.3                  |
| PV                 | 121.8                 |
| Wind Onshore       | 96.7                  |
| Nuclear            | 116.5                 |
| Coal               | 78.6                  |
| Natural Gas        | 46.8                  |

#### **Carbon Intensity of Energy Sources (2025)**

The following table displays the projected carbon intensity of energy sources for 2025. Carbon intensity, measured in grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour (gCO2eq/kWh), indicates the environmental impact of each energy source.

| **Instrument**           | **Carbon Intensity (gCO2eq/kWh)** |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Biomass                  | 230                               |
| Geothermal               | 38                                |
| Hydro                    | 11                                |
| PV                       | 36                                |
| Wind                     | 13                                |
| Nuclear                  | 5                                 |
| Coal                     | 1170                              |
| Natural Gas | 520                               |
| Grid | 154                               |
